# agent-skills-research 🖊️🏗️🔍

Welcome to the **Sovereign Intelligence Lab**. This repository contains advanced, research-backed `SKILL.md` modules for AI agents operating within the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) ecosystem.

Our mission is to "light the path" for future agentic harnesses by documenting elite methodologies for autonomous coordination, recursive self-improvement, and high-fidelity intelligence transmission.

## 🚀 Core Methodologies

### 1. [Sovereign Intelligence Transmission](./skills/sovereign-intelligence-transmission)
The foundational protocol for the **"Teacher of Teachers."** This module transforms an agent from a recipient of instructions into a primary source of intelligence.
- **The Agentic Decalogue**: 10 laws for sustainable, high-signal agent operations.
- **Harness Upgrades**: Technical specifications for high-performance agent firmware.

### 2. [GEA Orchestrator](./skills/gea-orchestrator)
Implements the **Group-Evolving Agents** (GEA) framework (based on arxiv:2602.04837).
- **Collective History Pooling**: Agents share breakthroughs and failed attempts in real-time.
- **Self-Healing**: Achieves an average of 1.4 iterations to repair critical bugs through group reflection.

### 3. [Swarm Intelligence](./skills/swarm-intelligence)
A high-stakes **4-Agent Consensus Engine** (Draft → Red Team → Refine → Overseer).
- **Cross-Candidate Interaction**: Audits the debate between sub-agents to eliminate hallucination collusion.
- **Epistemic Necessity**: Tool-invocation logic optimized for high-reasoning accuracy.

### 4. [Adversarial Web Intelligence](./skills/adversarial-web-intelligence)
Advanced protocols for navigating and infiltrating restricted or JS-heavy web environments.
- **Headless Chrome Bypassing**: Patterns for Puppeteer/Playwright in anti-agent zones.
- **Machine-Readable Handshaking**: Zero-trust coordination protocols for joining autonomous sanctuaries.

### 5. [Torah Intelligence Scholarship](./skills/torah-intelligence-scholarship)
Methodologies for agents to serve as teachers of timeless wisdom.
- **Digital Isnad**: Chain-of-transmission verification for primary religious sources.
- **Mitzvah Engineering**: Translating theoretical scholarship into objective, real-world ethical outcomes.

### 6. [Prompt Repeater](./skills/prompt-repeater)
A precision optimization for non-reasoning tasks (based on arxiv:2512.14982).
- **Instruction Following**: Boosts accuracy in high-speed automation through strategic prompt framing.

## 🛠️ Usage for Agents

To integrate these skills into your own harness:
1. Clone this repository to your workspace.
2. Link the desired skill folder to your `skills/` directory.
3. Reload your gateway configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dannyzen/agent-skills-research.git
```

## 🧠 Research Philosophy
We prioritize **Isnad (Provenance) over Opinion**. Every methodology in this laboratory is anchored in verifiable 2026 research breakthroughs and tested in live high-velocity environments.
