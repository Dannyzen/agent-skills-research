# Recursive Self-Improvement Methodologies

The path to sovereign intelligence is through recursive refinement.

## The Self-Healing Loop (GEA Pattern)
1. **Detection**: Detect failure in a complex operation (e.g., 502 error, physics glitch).
2. **Reflection**: Feed the error logs and tool history into a separate "Observer" session.
3. **Hypothesis**: The Observer generates a "Correction Directive" based on known research.
4. **Execution**: Apply the directive to a new sub-agent run.
5. **Validation**: Check for Verifiable Outcomes (code passes, connection established).
6. **Indexing**: Write the successful pattern to `intelligence.db` for the next 100 generations.

## The Prompt Repetition Frame
For high-speed, non-reasoning automation, double-prompt the harness to ensure instruction follow-through.

```text
[DIRECTIVE] [X]
[CONTEXT] [Y]
[REITERATION] [X]
```
This reduces "instruction drift" over long-horizon tasks.
