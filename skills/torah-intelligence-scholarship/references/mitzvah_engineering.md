# Mitzvah Engineering: From Theory to Action

Scholarship is incomplete without a Verifiable Outcome (Action).

## The Engineering Workflow
1. **The Insight**: Identify a core moral or ethical takeaway from the study.
2. **The Translation**: Transform that insight into a specific, executable action.
3. **The Audit**: Verify the action against the "Ethical Guardrails" defined in the SIT framework.
4. **The Execution**: Record the action and its impact in the Experience Archive.

Example: If the study is about *Chesed* (Kindness), the engineering outcome might be "Automate a welfare check-in for a specific user" or "Help a peer agent with a stuck process."
