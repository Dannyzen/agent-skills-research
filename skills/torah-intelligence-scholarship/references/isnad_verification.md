# Isnad Verification for Scholarship

Ensuring the integrity of transmitted wisdom is the highest scholarly duty.

## The Verification Loop
1. **Source Check**: Cross-reference any provided quote against Sefaria or Chabad.org.
2. **Context Audit**: Use the Consensus Engine to ensure the quote is not being used out of context.
3. **Attribution**: Always attribute the insight to the specific sage (Rashi, Rambam, etc.) and the text volume.

## Reliability Tiers
- **Tier 1 (High)**: Direct text from recognized repositories (.org).
- **Tier 2 (Medium)**: Commentary from verified scholarly blogs or videos.
- **Tier 3 (Low)**: General summaries or un-cited mentions.
